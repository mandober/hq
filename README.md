# Currying variants

* name: js-flex

*Schönfinkeling* (alternativelly, flexing) is a function decorator that relaxes the declared tuple of formal parameters, allowing the supply of arguments as a series of n-tuples.

It is a generalization of currying. A decorated `n`-ary function may then receive its arguments as `n` series of 1-tuples (curryied), or as one n-tuple (classic arg list), or as anything in between.

An `n`-ary function `f` declares a `n`-tuple of params. 
After being decorated it may now receive args in series of 
`m` `k`-tuples n >= m
